# NFLScheduleAPI

This short project retrieves all NFL matchups in a given week based on the user's inputs. The user enters both the year and the week that they want to retrieve the matchups from. Given the user inputs, the program will both print out and write to a CSV file all matchups given the week and year. 

This short project is actually part of a larger personal project that I am currently working on.
